# EmployeeBurnoutTracker
 This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze and predict employee burnout. It focuses on identifying key factors influencing burnout, such as resource allocation and mental fatigue scores, and provides actionable insights to mitigate its impact.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Preprocessing, handling missing values, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Predictive Modeling**: Supervised linear regression to predict burnout levels.
- **Visualization**: Insights and patterns visualized through various plots.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation using RÂ², RMSE, and MAE.
